> **Zero-dependency MCP server for Google Ads Keyword Planner.**
> Pre-built native binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows. No Node.js. No Python. No .NET runtime. No Go toolchain. Download one binary and configure your AI tool.

Expose Google Ads Keyword Planner data directly to AI assistants like Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Ask your AI to find keyword opportunities, analyze search volume trends, and forecast ad performance -- all grounded in real Google keyword data.

---

## Why This Exists

AI assistants are powerful at SEO and content strategy -- but they need real keyword data. This MCP server bridges your AI tool to the Google Ads Keyword Planner API, giving it:

- **Keyword ideas** -- related keywords with average monthly searches, competition level, and CPC estimates from a seed keyword or URL
- **Historical metrics** -- search volume trends, competition scores, and bid ranges for any list of keywords
- **Forecasts** -- projected impressions, clicks, and cost for a set of keywords at a given max CPC bid

With this MCP server configured, you can ask your AI: _"What keywords should I target for a blog post about dependency injection in C#? What's the search volume and competition look like?"_ and get a real data-backed answer.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `generate_keyword_ideas` | Related keywords from seeds, a URL or a site: filtered, brand-free, deduplicated and ranked |
| `get_historical_metrics` | Exact-keyword lookup with bids, average CPC, 24-month trend and brand check |
| `get_keyword_forecast` | Projected clicks, CTR, average CPC and cost per keyword at a given max CPC |
| `score_topics` | Screen candidate topics: best offerName, runner-ups, bidder evidence and verdict |
| `find_offer_variants` | Expand a topic with commercial modifiers and recommend the exact offerName |
| `compare_keyword_markets` | Compare keywords across countries and languages |
| `find_seasonal_opportunities` | Commercial keywords peaking in an upcoming launch window |
| `get_targeting_reference` | Language/country codes, presets, thresholds and lexicons (no API quota) |

Every tool accepts `countries` (ISO codes or presets like `DACH`) and scores each keyword for AdSense-for-Search arbitrage: bids in account currency, demand tier, commercial intent, brand flag, trend and a launch/borderline/skip verdict. See [AFS scoring](docs/afs-scoring.md). The C# build implements only the first three tools.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

You need:

1. A **Google Ads manager account (MCC)** -- developer tokens are only issued to manager accounts, not regular accounts. Create one free at [ads.google.com/home/tools/manager-accounts](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/manager-accounts/) if you don't have one.

2. A **Google Ads developer token with Basic or Standard access** -- in your manager account, go to `https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter` and copy your developer token.

   > **⚠️ New tokens start in test mode.** A brand-new developer token can only call the API against [Google Ads test accounts](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/best-practices/test-accounts). Calls to any real account return `DEVELOPER_TOKEN_NOT_APPROVED` until you apply for Basic access. To apply: in the API Center (`https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter`), click **Apply for Basic Access** and fill in the form. Google reviews requests within a few days. You do not need Standard access -- Basic access is sufficient for the Keyword Planner API.

3. A **Google Ads account with billing configured** -- the Keyword Planner API requires an account with an active payment method. You do not need to run any ads or spend money; you just need a payment method on file. This can be your manager account itself (if it has billing) or a separate sub-account.

   > **Note on `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID`:** If the account you use for `GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID` is a sub-account managed through your manager account, set `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` to your manager account ID. If you are calling the account directly (i.e., the OAuth user has direct access to it without going through a manager), you can omit `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID`.

4. A **Google Cloud project** with the [Google Ads API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/googleads.googleapis.com) enabled.
5. An **OAuth2 client ID and secret** from your GCP project (Desktop app type -- see GCP setup below).
6. An **OAuth2 refresh token** obtained via a one-time authorization flow (see below). The OAuth2 flow must be completed as the Google account that has access to the Google Ads account you intend to use.
7. A **Google Ads customer ID** -- the ID of the account with billing (found in the top-right corner of the Google Ads UI). Dashes are optional: `123-456-7890` and `1234567890` both work.

### 2. GCP Setup

1. Go to [GCP Console → APIs & Services → Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Enable the **Google Ads API**: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/googleads.googleapis.com`
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen (`https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent`):
   - Select **External** → fill in app name and your email → **Save**
   - Add your own Google account as a **Test user**
   - Leave the app in **Testing** mode
4. Create an OAuth2 client: **+ Create Credentials → OAuth client ID → Desktop app** → Create
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 3. Obtain a Refresh Token

Run this one-time flow to get a refresh token. It starts a local HTTP listener to automatically capture the authorization code:

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
$clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
$clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
$redirectUri = "http://localhost:9876"
$authUrl = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=$clientId&redirect_uri=$([Uri]::EscapeDataString($redirectUri))&response_type=code&scope=$([Uri]::EscapeDataString('https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords'))&access_type=offline&prompt=consent"

$listener = [System.Net.HttpListener]::new()
$listener.Prefixes.Add("$redirectUri/")
$listener.Start()

Start-Process $authUrl

$context = $listener.GetContext()
$rawUrl = $context.Request.RawUrl
$responseText = "<html><body><h2>Auth complete! You can close this tab.</h2></body></html>"
$buffer = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($responseText)
$context.Response.ContentLength64 = $buffer.Length
$context.Response.OutputStream.Write($buffer, 0, $buffer.Length)
$context.Response.Close()
$listener.Stop()

$code = ($rawUrl -split "[?&]" | Where-Object { $_ -like "code=*" }) -replace "^code=", ""

$body = "client_id=$clientId&client_secret=$clientSecret&code=$([Uri]::EscapeDataString($code))&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=$([Uri]::EscapeDataString($redirectUri))"
$result = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token" -Body $body -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
Write-Host "Refresh token: $($result.refresh_token)"
```

**bash (Linux/macOS):**

```bash
CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:9876"

# Open auth URL in browser
open "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}&response_type=code&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fadwords&access_type=offline&prompt=consent"

# Start a temporary HTTP server to catch the redirect
CODE=$(python3 -c "
import http.server, urllib.parse, sys
class H(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        params = urllib.parse.parse_qs(urllib.parse.urlparse(self.path).query)
        print(params['code'][0], end='')
        self.send_response(200); self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b'Auth complete! Close this tab.')
        sys.exit(0)
    def log_message(self, *a): pass
http.server.HTTPServer(('', 9876), H).handle_request()
")

# Exchange for tokens
curl -s -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  -d "client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&client_secret=${CLIENT_SECRET}&code=${CODE}&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['refresh_token'])"
```

The `refresh_token` value printed is what you need. **Save it** -- you cannot retrieve it again.

### 4. Download the Binary

Download the latest binary for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ncosentino/google-keyword-planner-mcp/releases/latest).

| Platform | Go binary | C# AOT binary |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Linux x64 | `kwp-mcp-go-linux-amd64` | `kwp-mcp-csharp-linux-x64` |
| Linux ARM64 | `kwp-mcp-go-linux-arm64` | `kwp-mcp-csharp-linux-arm64` |
| macOS x64 | `kwp-mcp-go-darwin-amd64` | `kwp-mcp-csharp-osx-x64` |
| macOS ARM64 | `kwp-mcp-go-darwin-arm64` | `kwp-mcp-csharp-osx-arm64` |
| Windows x64 | `kwp-mcp-go-windows-amd64.exe` | `kwp-mcp-csharp-win-x64.exe` |
| Windows ARM64 | `kwp-mcp-go-windows-arm64.exe` | `kwp-mcp-csharp-win-arm64.exe` |

### 5. Configure Your MCP Client

#### GitHub Copilot CLI / Claude Code

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keyword-planner": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/kwp-mcp-go-linux-amd64",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "your-developer-token",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your-refresh-token",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID": "your-sub-account-id",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID": "your-manager-account-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Some MCP clients (e.g. GitHub Copilot CLI) require `"args": []` to be present when `"type": "stdio"` is specified. Claude Desktop does not require it. If your client fails to load the server, try adding `"args": []`.

#### Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keyword-planner": {
      "command": "/path/to/kwp-mcp-go-linux-amd64",
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "your-developer-token",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your-refresh-token",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID": "your-sub-account-id",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID": "your-manager-account-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Important: Manager Account + Sub-Account Setup

The `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` credential is the manager/MCC account ID. It is required **only when your `GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID` account is a sub-account managed through a manager account** -- it tells the API which manager to authenticate through by sending it as the `login-customer-id` HTTP header.

If the account you set as `GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID` is directly accessible by your OAuth credentials (i.e., you can see it in `listAccessibleCustomers` and it is not being accessed through a manager), you can omit `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID`.

When in doubt: set it to your manager account ID. It doesn't hurt to include it even when not strictly required.

Both IDs can be found in the Google Ads UI -- the account number shown in the top-right corner when viewing that account. Dashes are optional -- `123-456-7890` and `1234567890` both work.

## Important: Billing Requirement

The Google Ads Keyword Planner API **requires an account with billing configured**. Accounts without an active payment method return errors regardless of credentials. You do not need to run any ads or spend money -- you just need a payment method on file.

## Common Errors

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `DEVELOPER_TOKEN_NOT_APPROVED` | Your developer token is in test mode and cannot access real accounts | Apply for Basic access at `https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter` and wait for Google approval (a few days) |
| `USER_PERMISSION_DENIED` with mention of `login-customer-id` | The account is a managed sub-account but `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` is missing or wrong | Set `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` to your manager account ID |
| `USER_PERMISSION_DENIED` without mention of `login-customer-id` | The OAuth user doesn't have access to the customer account | Complete the OAuth flow as the Google account that owns or has access to the ads account |
| HTTP 400 `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Often a malformed customer ID or missing required field | Check that `GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID` contains only digits (dashes are stripped automatically) |

---

## Configuration Reference

Credentials are resolved in this priority order: **CLI flag > environment variable > `.env` file**.

| Credential | CLI flag | Environment variable | Required | Description |
|------------|----------|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| Developer token | `--developer-token` | `GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN` | Yes | From Google Ads API Center (manager account) |
| OAuth2 client ID | `--client-id` | `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | From GCP OAuth2 credentials |
| OAuth2 client secret | `--client-secret` | `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | From GCP OAuth2 credentials |
| Refresh token | `--refresh-token` | `GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Yes | From one-time OAuth2 flow |
| Customer ID | `--customer-id` | `GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID` | Yes | Sub-account ID with billing (not the manager account) |
| Login customer ID | `--login-customer-id` | `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` | Yes* | Manager/MCC account ID. Required when using a sub-account. |

> \* Required when `GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID` is a managed sub-account (accessed through a manager/MCC account). Can be omitted if your OAuth credentials have direct access to the customer account.

The Go binary also reads `KWP_MAX_QPS` (API requests per second, default `1`, `0` disables pacing) `KWP_CACHE_TTL` (how long identical planner requests are cached, default `12h`, `0` disables caching) and `KWP_CACHE_MAX_MB` (cache size budget, default `64`).

### `.env` File

Place a `.env` file in the same directory as the binary:

```env
GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=your-developer-token
GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token
GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID=your-sub-account-id
GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID=your-manager-account-id
```

---

## Transports

Both binaries default to **stdio** and also support one shared Streamable HTTP
service for every agent session:

```bash
./kwp-mcp-go-linux-amd64 \
  --transport http \
  --listen-address 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8082
```

Keep the Google Ads credentials in the service environment or a `.env` file
beside the binary. MCP is served at `/mcp`; supervisors can probe `/health`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keyword-planner": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8082/mcp",
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Both implementations default to loopback, validate Host and Origin boundaries,
limit request sizes and HTTP timeouts, and run statelessly without session
affinity.

The HTTP host does not authenticate ordinary MCP callers. Keep it on loopback
or place it behind TLS and an authenticated reverse proxy. See
[Shared Service](https://www.devleader.ca/projects/google-keyword-planner-mcp/shared-service/)
and [Transports](https://www.devleader.ca/projects/google-keyword-planner-mcp/transports/).

## Go vs C# -- Which Binary to Use?

The Go binary implements all eight tools; the C# binary implements `generate_keyword_ideas`, `get_historical_metrics` and `get_keyword_forecast` with the original parameters.

| | Go | C# AOT |
|---|---|---|
| Binary size | ~12 MB | ~20 MB |
| Startup time | < 5ms | ~20ms |
| Memory usage | Lower | Slightly higher |
| Platform | All | All |
| Transports | stdio, HTTP | stdio, HTTP |

For most MCP use cases, either works fine. The Go binary starts slightly faster; the C# binary may be preferred if you're already in a .NET ecosystem. Both support the same [HTTP transport](#transports) with equivalent security defaults.

---

## Building from Source

### Go

```bash
cd go
go build -o kwp-mcp-go .
```

### C#

```bash
cd csharp
dotnet publish src/KeywordPlannerMcp/KeywordPlannerMcp.csproj -r linux-x64 -c Release --self-contained true
```

Replace `linux-x64` with your target RID (`win-x64`, `osx-arm64`, etc.).
